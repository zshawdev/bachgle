# Bachgel

Bachgle—portmanteau of ‘Bach’, the famous baroque musical composer, and “beagle”, the lovable dog breed—is a web app created as part of the beagle-themed BeagleHacks hackathon. Bachgle allows one to hear Bach’s two-part inventions performed a cappella by beagles!

Bachgle is built primarily with React & the Tone.js Web Audio framework.

After parsing Bach-encoded MIDI data (MIDI being a standard used for musical information) into JSON, Tone.js is utilized to interpret the now-JSON musical data for real-time realization of music in the browser. What’s more, Tone.js allows for use of a custom sound source: enter our friend, the beagle! With just the click of a button, you can hear the music of the timeless composer sung by the breed-of-the-hour.
